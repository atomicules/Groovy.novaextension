**Groovy** is (at the current time) a rough and ready [Nova extension](https://extensions.panic.com/) for the [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org) programming language
<!--
ðŸŽˆ It can also be helpful to include a screenshot or GIF showing your extension in action:

## Requirements

Groovy requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

- Java (However that maybe: Homebrew, or [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases), or other)


## Usage


<!--
ðŸŽˆ Alternatively, if your extension runs automatically (as in the case of a validator), consider showing users what they can expect to see:
-->

Groovy runs any time you open a local project, automatically lints all open files, then reports errors and warnings in Nova's **Issues** sidebar and the editor gutter:

### Configuration

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension offers global- or workspace-scoped preferences, consider pointing users toward those settings. For example:
-->

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select Groovy's **Preferences** tab.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project â†’ Project Settings...**

### Developing

This extension bundles in the [Groovy Language Server](https://github.com/GroovyLanguageServer/groovy-language-server). That will need updating periodically. Follow their README instructions to update the jar.
